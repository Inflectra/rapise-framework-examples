
# FWLISv1 - Framework for Libraryinformationsystem v1.

This testing framwork works with first version of LibraryInformationSystem.org 
website, but it demonstrates a number of recommended practices for Rapise framework
design starting from Rapise 8 in a nutshell.

	Note: We have a dedicated training covering all the features demonstrated
	in this example. For larger team we recommend to consider Inflectra training
	by contacting sales because it also includes team work and collaboration
	which is an essential skill.


Here is an overview of what this framework demonstrates:

1. Test Case folders (Author Management)
2. Test case tags (draft, template, skip)
3. Shared data
4. Dropdowns
5. RVL Page Object with common functionality (LISCommon)
6. Shared repository exported from the PageObject (LISCommon).
7. JavaScript PageObject (LISRest)
8. Utility PageObject (TableHandler) - used to deal with <table>...</table> on a
page without need ot learn an object.
9. Dropdowns.xlsx (try using LISCommon.DoLoginAs)
10. Running test cases from test cases (!Full - Author Management)
