
This testing framwork works with first version of LibraryInformationSystem.org 
website, but it demonstrates a number of recommended practices for Rapise framework
design starting from Rapise 8 in a nutshell.

	Note: We have a dedicated training covering all the features demonstrated
	in this example. For larger team we recommend to consider Inflectra training
	by contacting sales because it also includes team work and collaboration
	which is an essential skill.
