## Web Library Template

This is a template for extending web testing capabilities of Rapise with support for complex Web UI controls, e.g. grids, lists, form fields.

In Rapise one can define a complex object that spans across multiple DOM nodes. Using such a definition Rapise is able to recognize the object during recording and action on it during test playback.
